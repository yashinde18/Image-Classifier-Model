In this course, we are going to focus on five learning objectives:

1 Setting up and getting an overview of Colab notebook

2 Loading data, previewing and visualizing data for model

3 Preprocessing and Normalizing the data for model training

4 Model architecture setup, training and evaluation

5 Model testing on data and wrap-up
